====

test repository, you can practice push/pull ops here

This is a repository for test. Just do anything you want
to do to learn how to use GitHub.

To learn about Github, you can goto
https://help.github.com/

You should install GitHub for Windows first.

It's recommend to use git shell rather than git GUI.
Learn more about Git, you can refer to "Git权威指南".

Now I am going to test what if conflict happens.
This is some changes made on-line.

When I tried to type "git push" on Local Machine, it blamed:
To https://github.com/BitRanger/test.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/BitRanger/test.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
